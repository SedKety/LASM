we'll need 2 loops, as the time complexity of selection sort is noted as n^2
i'll create an innerloop, and an outerloop. 
one that encompasses the array itself and the other that triggers the other one while resetting the values for the next loop

so:

outerloop:
-Saves the smallest value from the innerloop
-Increment the outerloop counter by one
-Resets the values used in the innerloop 4


innerloop:

-check if the element at the current position[arrayptr + outerloop] is smaller than the smallest set value,
-Swap if so. 
-Increment the innerloop by one
